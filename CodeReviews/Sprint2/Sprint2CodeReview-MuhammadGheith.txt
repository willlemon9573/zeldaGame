EnemyFactory - Jarek

Very good. Code is well partitioned and lean. Source rectangles are blocked well making their purpose clear. Very little to no "fluffy" code.

BlockFactory - Aaron

Also very well done. Code is partitioned with little coupling. No method has more than 10 lines of code. Well be very easy to use in the future.
