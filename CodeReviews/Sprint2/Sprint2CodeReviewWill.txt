The code in general is very readable and easy to understand. The few suggestions that I have are very nitpicky. I would like to see some more comments, I would like to see more comments similar to the one about currentFrameIndex, especially for the variables initialized at the beginning. There are a lot of parameters being passed in the constructor, it makes it hard to keep track of everything that it does.

Jerekâ€™s code is very maintainable, I can see that he is thinking about how this will be used for the rest of the year.I have a few things that I would like to see updated though. totalFrames should be data driven, not all enemies will have exactly 2 frames of animation. I also think that getting variables for the size of the destinationRectangle would be more maintainable because not all enemies are the same size. I also wonder if timeToUpdate should change. At this point in time all enemies update their sprite at the same rate, would certain enemies move/update their sprites other than others?
