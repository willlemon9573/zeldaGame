Reviewing UnlockDoorCommand code maintainability
Code written by Aaron Heishman

A well written piece of code. Very little fluff, nothing appears to be coupled. Execution attempts the "OpenDoor" function, perform if possible and cancelling if not. Use fires a method in the code for using a key. Code function is seperated out to seperate functions to make editting easier.

A couple criticisms are- the puchback command could instead reference a "PushBack" command instead of writing its own. That way if a change is made to pushback, it would update the method for both. 
I would also set the "Unlock" function as its own command, so that if we wanted to make unlocking a door by down through a different method, we can.
