Reviewing PushBlockCommand for readability

As code, the command is fairly easy to read. If player appears from the bottom (written into the variable check), the block is moved. Comments written make it clear what each part of the function should do.

Good use of variable names to make clear what each variable is being used for. I dont have any criticisms of its readability, the function is clear.
