DungeonRoom for readability (Author Aaren):
In the context of the game your DungeonRoom class has a role and responsibility. It effectively manages the state and behavior of a room, within the dungeon showing an understanding of the gameâ€™s domain. The use of collection types like List<IEntity> and Dictionary<Direction Vector2> ensures type safety. Enhances code readability and maintainability.
However, there are some areas that could be improved. Currently your class does not implement any interfaces. Implementing interfaces can benefit the design by promoting coupling between components and making testing easier. For example introducing an IDungeonRoom interface could be advantageous.
To enhance readability, it would be beneficial to organize fields by grouping ones and using comments to separate them. This way enemy related fields can be grouped together followed by item related fields creating a structure.
The class currently exposes properties that directly expose lists (e.g., LiveEnemyList). This may lead to manipulation of these lists from sources. It would be better to provide methods that allow controlled manipulation of exposing these lists. 
Some methods like Draw() are performing tasks at once. Breaking down these methods, into focused ones would bring benefits in terms of code clarity and maintainability.
For instance, you could assign the task of drawing types of entities to methods such, as DrawEnemies or DrawItems. Additionally, it is practice including debugging tools like Debug.Assert in production code. However, it is important to use these tools or wrap them under a flag. While Debug.Assert can be beneficial for identifying errors in the development process its usage in production code should be careful and selective. Lastly consistency, in naming conventions is crucial. For example, while _roomEvents is written entirely in lowercase other private fields begin with an underscore followed by a capital letter.
