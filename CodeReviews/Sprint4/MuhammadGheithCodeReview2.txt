Review EntityBase on level-building-update

The code is very lean and simple, a good use of an Abstract class. This gives all "EntityBase" objects access to the created code variables.

I believe that the requirement of overloading the "CreateEntity" function could be replaced with a virtual implementation- ie perhaps there can be a baseline object that gets rendered if the object has not yet implemented its own version. This could be useful for bugtesting.

The code will be easy to manage thanks to its abstract nature.
