XMLParser.cs

The code is readable on a design level. A Dictionary is made with function calls stored as values via lambadas. Thia makes the main while-loop call in the "Parse(string)" function quite clear.
Each function is clearly named, and their code is lean. This will make the code easy to update since it can be focused on adding new functions.
However there's a lack of comments in the code which can make it hard to debug. There are if-statements could probably be replaced with Debug.Asserts(), or maybe more Labmda functions.
