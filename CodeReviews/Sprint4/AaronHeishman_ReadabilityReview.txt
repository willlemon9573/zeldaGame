Comments:

As of right now this class doesn't have its full implementation, so I will be reviewing what is currently there right now. From what I'm reading there is a good use of commenting as you code. Variable names have been written in a way that makes them easy to understand what they're doing and each function call has is named specifically for the actions its supposed to do. 

- Initialize function
	There are some good naming conventions in this function for the variables and included comments to explain what's being parsed. Good naming conventions on the variables inside the parsing as well to explain exactly what the parser is parsing each time. The only thing that could help this is by adding a summary at the of the function to explain what the purpose of this function is

Unimplemented Functions
- Multiple functions have been made in preparation for updating the HUD. All of these functions are easy to read based off their names, but the function names break naming conventions. I would suggest fixing these as naming conventions for functions do not use camel case, but instead have each first letter of each word capitalized. There should also be some comments explaining what these functions are going to do even if their names are pretty explicit. 

Draw Function
 - Pretty easy to infer what is going on this function. Just a simple loop over the sprites in a tuple to draw them. However, there's commented code which should be removed as this isn't being used. This function is also missing a summary to explain it.
