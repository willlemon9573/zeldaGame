Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
First glance at the class file it seems very consistent, the constant 
variables are all in all caps, there are comments in place to ackknowledge different 
functions, or methods, and there are documentation on top of each function/method 
stating what it does and what parameters are needed. There is also error handling in place
which is great practice and good for maintainability too. 
Some things that can be improved upon is making sure that the documentation stays consistent, 
I see some functions that don't have any description for the parameters and/or return values.
Another action that may prove to be helpful is creating a class-level description for
the whole class and its purposes so that it is easy to tell what the class intended uses are.
Overall, the code is well documented and organized, there could be more added groupings for the 
functions such as the Add methods, Upgrade methods, bool methods/isininventory methods, and getstackablecount 
methods to make it even more organized and complete but that is just a suggestion. The code is very readable 
already and is documented very well.
