# Sprint 4 Reflection:
	This sprint has been a journey of learning and growth for our team. Despite the hurdles we encountered, it brought us closer as a unit. The challenge of game development
	in the absence of effective communication became evident during this sprint. We strived to meet each deadline, but regrettably, we fell short of fulfilling all the
	prerequisites. We experimented with new task management strategies, which proved to be quite effective. However, as the sprint progressed, we discovered unanticipated
	object interactions that necessitated the creation of additional components to ensure seamless integration. Sprint 4 served as a reality check for our team, humbling us
	all. As we look forward to Sprint 5, our goal is to have all implementations functioning smoothly, in addition to incorporating the extra features we proposed.

# Extra Notes regarding commits:
- Just a note for the graders as suggested by Aaron Post. There's going to be a bunch of Commits from me (Aaron Heishman) that are going to include a bunch of changes made to the repo itself due to how I incorrectly uploaded my Sprint0 source
- All the changes were made to prevent any future conflictions with all of the team members own visual studio settings or to remove my old code that won't be used during the merge with main
- We added suppressions for messages about using "new()" instead of "new Type()"
