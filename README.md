# Sprint 5 Reflection
	This sprint has been a journey to say the least. Throughout all of these sprints and this project, we are always reminded that communication is the single most important factor to a teams success. 		Although there were noticible improvements to our communication as a whole, it still was not enough to meet the deadline at the end. This sprint went a little smoother since we had a twist on how our 	tasks needed to be implemented. Team members each had an important task/feature they needed/wanted to implement to the game, and there is less overlap in code there. But still, without constant 		communication, it was hard to tell how each member was doing on their part until the very last minute. 
# Extra Notes regarding commits:
- Just a note for the graders as suggested by Aaron Post. There's going to be a bunch of Commits from me (Aaron Heishman) that are going to include a bunch of changes made to the repo itself due to how I incorrectly uploaded my Sprint0 source
- All the changes were made to prevent any future conflictions with all of the team members own visual studio settings or to remove my old code that won't be used during the merge with main
- We added suppressions for messages about using "new()" instead of "new Type()"
